# Description
My porfolio is a showcase of the applications I have created as a student in the Georgia Tech Full Stack Bootcamp.  I have included my resume and how to contact me on LinkedIn and GitHub.  
 

 # Purpose
 This portfolio is to highlight the skills I've learned learned in the Bootcamp course like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, API Calls, AJAX requests, and Firebase.  A complete showcase of all my work can be found on my GitHub portfolio.  Stay tuned for screen shots and recordings of server-side applications such as Node.js, React, Express, and MongoDB.
