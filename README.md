# Bootstrap Portfolio
 Recreated portfolio with Bootstrap features

 #Purpose
 This portfolio is to highlight the skills I've learned learned in the Bootcamp course like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, API Calls, AJAX requests, and Firebase.  You can check out examples of other repositories that I have created in the Portfolio section of the navbar.  This version takes advantage of Bootstrap's responsive layout versus writing in media queries in CSS.
